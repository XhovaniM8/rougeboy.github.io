                    I stitched the ache into fabric<br>
                    and wore it like velvet.<br>
                    The bottle sweats in my palm,<br>
                    but the mirror says — let 'em have it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Birds gather in circles,<br>
                    where the lights are low,<br>
                    and the poles keep spinning.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cash falls like snow,<br>
                    sticks like blood.<br>
                    Your name tastes sweeter<br>
                    when I don't say it aloud.<br>
                    Compatibility — a myth we wrote<br>
                    to excuse the wreckage.<br>
                    <br>
                    Life is suffering,<br>
                    but it dresses well.<br>
                    Love missed its bus again —<br>
                    no matter.<br>
                    I only walk on Fridays,<br>
                    never Tuesdays.<br>
                    <br>
                    Tell me again:<br>
                    what happens<br>
                    when the rolling stone trips?

                    laughing,<br>
                    and getting to see your face<br>
                    seemed so normal,<br>
                    like it would become something<br>

                    The 53rd floor of a gorgeous hotel<br>

                    Pizza and alcohol too.<br>

                    God, there are so many more:<br>

                    All I can wish for<br>
                    is that you stay in my life<br>
                    somehow and some way,<br>
                    without it being forced,<br>
                    because a love like this is special.<br>

                    The question if this is extra<br>
                    appears in my mind<br>
                    and naturally I tell myself<br>
                    that there is no such thing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Extra seems to be the new normal anyways.<br>
                    <br>
                    I can count on both hands<br>
                    the amount of girls I have seen<br>
                    with half-blonde half-black bangs,<br>
                    to the point where it's no longer unique.<br>
                    <br>
                    Extra has become less-extra<br>
                    in the 21st century I guess?<br>
                    <br>
                    What about the fact that<br>
                    there are two older women<br>
                    speaking french in front of me<br>
                    as I craft this.<br>
                    <br>
                    How is that extra you ask?<br>
                    <br>
                    French is extra.

                    Life without you<br>
                    is just not as fulfilling.

                    that you told me to stop drinking and driving.<br>
                    <br>
                    You have helped me stay afloat<br>
                    when the inevitable occurs.<br>
                    <br>
                    That's why I try to do the same for you<br>
                    and if I can make you crack a smile<br>
                    or laugh or anything<br>
                    then there is no greater joy for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is all a heavy and sentimental way<br>
                    of saying "thank you" and "I love you".<br>
                    <br>
                    Sincerely,<br>
                    your somewhat odd & somewhat charming lover,<br>
                    rouge boy.
