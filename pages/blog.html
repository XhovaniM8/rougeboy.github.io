          I think we found an empty office in Midtown. This is very exciting,
          since I can create a workspace that is more amicable to working and
          not browsing Reddit. That is mostly a joke, but hopefully the projects
          will come sooner rather than later. I'm happy with the look of the
          website so far though.
        </p>

        <h2>January</h2>
        <p>More to come soon... I'm trying to get an office.</p>

        <div class="blog__header--text">
          <h1>2022</h1>
          <h1>A Year in Review</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          It's been seven months since I graduated from college. Seven months
          since I left my "set" path in the schooling system (Although I chose
          to do four years for a bachelor's in Computer Engineering, I do not
          consider that a choice since it was expected of me and I had no other
          idea what to do).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, the economy has changed drastically once again which has
          made work sort of difficult to come by for an entry-level aspiring
          Engineer. Instead of pouting, I just took the opportunity to work on
          skills. I went after an audio-visual commissioning part-time job to
          stay busy and keep my pockets from getting to slim--but I mostly have
          been planning and going at projects. I have also worked on my creative
          ideas forming "rouge boy." which will be a platform for my own
          creative ventures such as fragrances and hosting art.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first of my projects that have come to fruition. Here I
          can showcase my writing, art, and most importantly my technical
          projects. That's what a portfolio does duh.
