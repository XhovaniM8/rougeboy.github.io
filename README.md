## How it's made:
**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

I wrote this website using VSCode. I started the Odin Project where I learned about general front-end development. After learning Flex-Box and how to build a responsive website page, I took to working on my own portfolio page with my own design. I will finish the Odin Project and add Java Script in the near future and continously update the page with content and technology.
