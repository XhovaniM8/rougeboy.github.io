# My Portfolio
This is my website / portfolio.

## How it's made:
**Tech used:** HTML & CSS
**Hardware Used** Nikon D3300 55mm Lens (default)

I used HTML and CSS to create this website, and took inspiration from what I learned in the Odin Project's front-end development course. After getting comfortable with Flex-Box and building responsive web pages, I designed my own portfolio page from scratch using VSCode. I plan to finish the Odin Project, add JavaScript, and continue updating this page with fresh content and new technology.

## Optimizations:
To make my site faster and more efficient, I compressed all images to 90% quality, which saves about 10% in loading time. I also implemented Google Analytics to track website traffic. I'm working with Google's PageSpeed Insights tool to analyze issues that may affect website speed. 

## Lessons Learned:
Through creating this portfolio, I've gained valuable experience in front-end development, including design principles, responsive layouts, and image optimization.

## To-Do
In the future, I hope to keep improving this website by incorporating new technologies and updating its content.
